It has a significant global impact, with an estimated 463 million adults living with diabetes worldwide. The condition can lead to various complications, including cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision impairment. Diabetes can affect the quality of life by requiring daily management, including monitoring blood sugar levels, taking medication or insulin, and following a healthy diet and exercise regimen. It poses a risk for long-term health complications and can increase the likelihood of premature death. Furthermore, the economic burden of diabetes is substantial, with healthcare costs, lost productivity, and reduced quality of life affecting individuals, families, and healthcare systems globally. Early detection, proper management, and lifestyle modifications are crucial in preventing complications and improving the overall well-being of individuals with diabetes.</div>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
